Wakefield is certainly an adjustment from city life but they are starting to feel more at home, with lots of support from two local host families and our volunteers.

Vitalii continues his studies online to complete his degree in Applied Computer Science. The biggest advantage of Chelsea, they said, has been the incredible support from their host family and the local community.
