If you are able to help please <a href="https://forms.gle/E5u9ddp5PjyCBkFAA">complete our volunteer form</a>.

                We are seeking Ukrainian families who would be interested in settling in our community, either temporarily or longer-term. Wakefield, Quebec and its surroundings are primarily rural areas established along the Gatineau River. The village of Wakefield has several shops and services, including a hospital and English elementary school, but for most job and educational opportunities, families would need to drive to the larger cities of Gatineau, Quebec or Ottawa, Ontario, as public transportation is limited. Our volunteers are here to help with transportation, as well as other settlement needs.
