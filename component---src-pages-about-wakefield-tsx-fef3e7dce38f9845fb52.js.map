Wakefield is part of the larger municipality of La Pêche, QC, which covers an area of 598 square kilometers. The population of La Pêche was 7,863 according to the 2016 census. The population density is approximately 13 people per square kilometer. Nearby communities include Masham, Alcove, Rupert, Chelsea, and Cantley.</p>\n\n            <p>Core sectors of the economy are tourism, agriculture, services, residential construction and related trades. A considerable number of residents work in the public service for the federal government and either commute into the city (Ottawa or Gatineau) or work from home.</p>\n\n            <p>The cost of living is lower than many other parts of Canada. This quiet, primarily rural community is amazing for people who enjoy the outdoors and the village lifestyle. It is also a very safe place for families with young children. It’s a welcoming community made up of many newcomers from other parts of Canada. People take care of their neighbours and there is an amazing community spirit, as well as a vibrant arts scene.</p>\n            <Snapshot src={Snapshot1} />\n        </Section>\n        <Section>\n            <Header2>Getting around</Header2>\n            <p>For most job and educational opportunities, expect to drive to the larger urban centres of Gatineau, Quebec or Ottawa, Ontario, which are both about 35 kilometers away.</p>\n\n            <p>Public transportation is limited but there is a commuter bus available on weekdays during peak hours.

The vast majority of local services, including healthcare, can be accessed in English. It is helpful, however, especially when communicating with government service providers and French school administrators to speak some basic French. Free French classes are available through the Government of Quebec.</p>\n\n        </Section>\n        <Section>\n            <Header2>Local services</Header2>\n            <p><em>This is not a complete list but offers a sense of the main services available locally.</em></p>\n\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"https://cisss-outaouais.gouv.qc.ca/hopitaux/wakefield/\">Wakefield Memorial Hospital (In French only)</a> and residential and long-term care centre</li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.brunet.ca/en/store-locator/wakefield-895-chemin-riverside-j0x-3g0/5110/\">Brunet pharmacy</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"http://wakefield.wqsb.qc.ca/\">Wakefield Elementary School(English school)</a> * Please note that under Quebec’s language laws, all immigrants from outside Canada are required to attend school in French</li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://localisateur.bnc.ca/succursale/banque-nationale/741-chemin-riverside-wakefield/\">National Bank / Banque nationale branch</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://centrewakefieldlapeche.ca/\">Centre Wakefield La Pêche</a> (centre for recreation, culture and community events, including a library)</li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wakefieldgeneralstore/\">Wakefield General Store(grocery store)</a></li>\n                <li>Medical clinics: <a href=\"https://cliniquecollines.ca/en/clinique/la_clinique/\">Clinique des collines</a> and <a href=\"https://bonjour-sante.ca/uno/clinic/cdemfamilialedewakefield\">Centre de Médecine familiale de Wakefield</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.iga.net/en/find_a_store/store/8371-iga-famille-charles-chelsea\">IGA Family Charles</a> (larger grocery store)</li>\n            </ul>\n\n        </Section>\n        <Section>\n            <Header2>Local businesses</Header2>\n            <p>The village has a small number of restaurants, bars, cafés, and bakeries.
